[![Remix on Glitch](https://cdn.glitch.com/2703baf2-b643-4da7-ab91-7ee2a2d00b5b%2Fremix-button.svg)](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/import/github/galtenberg/evernote-react-express)

Example application created from [create-react-app-fullstack](https://github.com/ekatzenstein/create-react-app-fullstack), minus postgresql.

You'll probably want to use react-scripts 1.x outside of glitch (has too many dependencies / requires too much disk space on glitch).
